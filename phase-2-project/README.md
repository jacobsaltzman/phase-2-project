# Phase 2 -- React Project
# Coinfolio -- A Cryptocurrency Landing Pad


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Summary


Coinfolio is a single page web application that functions as a crypto encyclopedia and portfolio tool. It showcases top coins' stats and facts, allows users to add projects to the collection and mark their own investments in a portfolio. The idea is that it acts as a "landing pad" to give people a place to ground themselves in the details of each individual aspect of a so immense and over-whelming world of blockchain/crypto.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## How it works for the user


In this web-application, users are presented first with a home page (home) that greats them and informs them of the function of the site. In the main page (coins), there is a rendered collection of the top cryptocurrencies with their names, some data like the project's white paper and github page, and an image/gif. They can also navigate to their own "portfolio" (folio) in which they will be able to save coins from the home page to make a collection and keep track of their own investments. Or they can navigate to the "Add New Coin" (Add Coin) and create a new coin card for the community to see on the main page. The CSS is a minimalist style from scratch and includes a darkmode/lightmode. 


Future additions in the works include adding a market page to view real-time market data and prices, event-handlers that when clicking a coin card would send the user to a more detailed description or straight to the Wiki page, ect.
